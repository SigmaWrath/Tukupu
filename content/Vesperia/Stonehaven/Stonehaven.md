#### Overview

#### Society
The government is led by the meritocratic [[Harmonium Council]], and the city is economically communist. Resources are shared equitably, and everyone gets what they need, and can make petitions to the central council for more if they can demonstrate need or benefit. Motivation is primarily for the good of the community, like in a localized household gift economy but on a larger scale. 

The low crime isn't because of strict enforcementâ€”it's because of restorative justice, as opposed to punitive justice. Most laws created are treated more like advisements, and there isn't a dedicated peacekeeping force, instead the strong community culture enables community members to solve disputes civilly with each other. Regulation of magic is also a set of advisements put out for safety reasons, and is enforced by honor and the belief that community members will be safe for self-interest.
#### History and Districts
Stonehaven was originally settled by [[Dwarves|dwarves]] who build a dense stone city out of granite from a quarry in the grasslands (this district is called [[Tongs Reach]]). Later, [[Halflings|halflings]] happened across the settlement, and joined the city, sparking the idea for lime deposits near a river to be used to build a new district for the new halflings (this district is called [[Limeheart]]). As the population increased, they expanded a district made mostly of wood and glass on top of cliff steps (this district is called [[Cliffsteps]]). Stone walls were eventually built around the city for defense, and there is farmland outside of the walls. [[Eldermist Gate]] is the district next to the gate in these walls bordering the Eldermist forest, and bordering the farmland outside of the walls are the districts of [[Old Ward]], [[Songborrow]], and [[Goldsheaf Hamlet]].
