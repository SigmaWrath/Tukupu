They are not a formal faction, nor do they hold any official titles. Instead, they are individuals from all walks of life—farmers, artisans, merchants, and even magicians—who, through their vigilance and cooperation, protect the city from hidden threats and ensure that the community remains peaceful, equitable, and functional.*</span>

While the Nightweavers do not openly reveal their identities, their presence is felt throughout Stonehaven, as they subtly address issues before they become problems, gather information, and ensure the safety and well-being of the city’s residents. Their work is driven by a shared sense of duty to the collective good, and they operate independently, often embedded in other guilds or factions, but their efforts are always geared toward serving the needs of the community as a whole.

Lending to their secretive nature, Nightweavers were founded by [[Selashah]] worshippers.
