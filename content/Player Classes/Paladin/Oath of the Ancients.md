> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Preserve life and light in the world.</span>* 

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first [[elves]] and the rituals of [[Druid|druids]]. [[Paladin|Paladins]] who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.

> <span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, I stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, I stand against the forces that would render it barren.</span>
> 
> <span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">I delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If I allow the light to die in my own heart, I can't preserve it in the world.</span>
### Mechanical Traits
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Nature's Wrath</span>
As an action, you can expend one use of your [[Channel Oath]] to conjure grasping spectral vines around nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [[Restrained]] condition for 1 minute. A Restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Oath of the Ancients Spells</span>

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Ancients Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


| Paladin Level | Spells                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 3             | [[Faerie Fire]], [[Speak with Animals]]      |
| 5             | [[Misty Step]], [[Moonbeam]]                 |
| 9             | [[Plant Growth]], [[Protection from Energy]] |
| 13            | [[Ice Storm]], [[Stoneskin]]                 |
| 17            | [[Commune with Nature]], [[Tree Stride]]     |
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 7: Aura of Warding</span>

Ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward, blunting energy from beyond the [[Vesperia|Material Plane]]; you and your allies have resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage while in your [[Aura of Protection]].

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 15: Undying Sentinel</span>

When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 Hit Point instead, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to three times your Paladin level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 20: Elder Champion</span>

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your [[Aura of Protection]] with primal power, granting the following benefits for 1 minute or until you end them as a Bonus Action:

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Diminish Defiance</span>**: Enemies in the aura have Disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and [[Channel Oath]] options.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Regeneration</span>**: At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 Hit Points.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Swift Spells</span>**: Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a Bonus Action instead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a 5th-level spell slot (no action required).
