> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Roam the lands as a gunslinging herder.</span>*

Rothé Rider [[Ranger|rangers]] emerged in the volcanic deserts of [[Gorano]] in [[Vesperia]], herding the [[Rothé|rothé]] that roamed there. With the rich mineral resources of the volcanic land and the innovative magical culture amongst the herders who dwelt there, experimentation with alchemy for spell components resulted in the serendipitous development of gunpowder. Eventually, this led to the creation of firearms, popularizing the gunslinging archetype for which cowgirls are famous.

Cowpoke rangers <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(aka Herder rangers, Cowpokes)</span> did not follow the traditional creation of conclaves, but rather, ranger magic found them. Herders protected their ranches and their cattle, respected the land and learned its secrets so they could survive on it, they bonded with their animal companions, and that was enough for the first traces of ranger magic to manifest in these newborn rangers. Years of refinement, perfecting, and teaching, have made of this emerging ranger way a true conclave, complete with masters, disciples, and traditions and lessons to follow.

Rothé Riders hear the whispers of the plains and speak back, they feel the primal emotions that govern the actions of the cattle they tend to, and they know of the deep unknowable magic that watches expectantly, waiting just at the edge of the light of the campfire.

### Mechanical Traits

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Beast Whisperer</span>

Your expertise and know-how of dealing with animals allows you to create a supernatural bond with any beast. As an action, you can attempt to befriend a Beast that can see and hear you and is within 30 feet of you. You must make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The DC for this check equals the 10 + CR of the beast, rounding up. 

If the check is successful, the beast is friendly to you, trusts you, and will heed some of your commands within reason. The beast won’t attack your enemies and it won’t engage in any action that will lead to its certain death. The beast will, among other things, bring you an object out of your reach, carry a message to someone it could reasonably find, indicate the way of a location it knows, scout ahead, or, if its biology permits it, carry you and be used as a mount. If you choose to do so, it gains +10 feet to its speed when you mount it. 

Willingly harming the beast will make it stop seeing you as a friend, at which point it might turn hostile depending on the nature of the beast in question, at the GM’s discretion. The beast will not leave the general location where it lives for more than 100 feet, as in, befriending an elk that lives in a particular forest means the elk won’t follow you anymore once you are 100 feet away from the forest it lives in.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Herder Spells</span>

When you reach a [[Ranger]] level specified in the Rothé Rider Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


| Ranger Level | Spells                |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| 3            | [[Animal Friendship]] |
| 5            | [[Find Steed]]        |
| 9            | [[Haste]]             |
| 13           | [[Dominate Beast]]    |
| 17           | [[Hold Monster]]      |

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Cowpoke Marksmanship</span> 

You gain proficiency with Firearms. Additionally, you also gain proficiency with [[Tinker’s Tools]], allowing you to craft ammo for any firearm for half the price it costs to buy it. Crafting a set of 10 rounds of ammo takes 1 hour.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 7: Hot Hand</span> 

Your expertise over firearms grows, making you an even more prodigious marksman. The range of all firearms is increased by 10 feet for you and you ignore the loading quality of firearms with which you are proficient.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 11: Magical Bull’s Eye</span> 

You gain the ability to infuse your bullets with your own magic, allowing you to perform a shot so precise it supernaturally tracks its target. When taking the Attack action with a firearm, you can spend one of your spell slots to empower this attack. 

When you do so, this attack gains a bonus to its Attack Roll and Damage Roll equal to the level of the spell slot used. The attack also ignores any bonuses from [[Half Cover]], and is not made at Disadvantage when firing at long range or against an enemy within 5 feet of you.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 15: Arcane Quick Draw</span> 

Spellcasting and shooting have become so natural to you that you are able to weave one and the other seamlessly. When you make a ranged weapon attack using a firearm against one creature, you can cast one [[Ranger|ranger]] spell you know as part of the same action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all uses of this ability after finishing a long rest.
