> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Draw on shadow magic to fight your foes.</span>* 

Gloom Stalker [[Ranger|rangers]] are at home in the darkest places, wielding magic drawn from the [[Shadowfell]] to combat enemies that lurk in darkness.

### Mechanical Traits

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Dread Ambusher</span>

You have mastered the art of creating frightening ambushes, granting you the following benefits:

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Ambusher’s Leap</span>**: At the start of the first turn of each combat, your Speed increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Frighten</span>**: Once per turn when you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 Psychic damage to the target and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, it has the [[Frightened]] condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Initiative Bonus</span>**: When you roll Initiative, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Gloom Stalker Spells</span>

The magic of the [[Shadowfell]] ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Gloom Stalker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Ranger Level | Spells                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 3            | [[Disguise Self]]        |
| 5            | [[Rope Trick]]           |
| 9            | [[Fear]]                 |
| 13           | [[Greater Invisibility]] |
| 17           | [[Seeming]]              |

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Umbral Sight</span>

You gain [[Darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on Darkvision. While entirely in [[Darkness (Rules)|Darkness]], you have the [[Invisible]] condition to any creature that relies on Darkvision to see you in that darkness.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 7: Iron Mind</span>

You have honed your ability to resist the mind altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 11: Stalker's Flurry</span>

When you use the [[Frighten]] effect of your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Dread Ambusher</span> feature, you can cause one of the following additional effects:

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Sudden Strike</span>**: You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon’s range.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Mass Fear</span>**: Each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the [[Frightened]] condition until the start of your next turn.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 15: Shadowy Dodge</span>

You can dodge with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. When a creature makes an Attack Roll against you, you can use your Reaction to impose Disadvantage on that roll. If the attack then misses, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
