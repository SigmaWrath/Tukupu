> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Adopt animal forms to guard the wilds.</span>* 

[[Druid|Druids]] of the Circle of the Moon draw on the magic of the moon to transform themselves and to guard the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and perform rituals. They wander the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks before crossing paths with another person, let alone another Druid.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druidâ€™s blood.

### Mechanical Traits

Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

In addition, you can cast the spells from this feature while you are in [[Wild Shape]] form.

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Lunar Radiance</span>**: Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage. You make this choice each time you hit with those attacks.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 10: Moonlight Step</span>

You magically transport yourself, reappearing amid a burst of moonlight. As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and you have Advantage on the next attack roll you make before the end of this turn.
