> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Harness secrets hidden in constellations.</span>*

The Circle of Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the [[Druid|druids]] of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos. 

### Mechanical Traits
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Star Map</span> 
You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [[Guidance]] and [[Guiding Bolt]] spells prepared, and you can cast [[Guiding Bolt]] without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.


| Map Forms                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| A scroll bearing depictions of constellations     |
| A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it |
| An owlbear hide tooled with stellar symbols       |
| A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover      |
| A crystal engraved with starry patterns           |
| A glass disk etched with constellations           |

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Starry Form</span>
As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your [[Wild Shape]] feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [[Incapacitated]] condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

- **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Archer</span>**: A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.
- **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Chalice</span>**: A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.
- **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Dragon</span>**: A constellation of a wise [[Dragons|dragon]] appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 6: Cosmic Omen</span>

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Star Map</span> for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

- **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Weal (Even)</span>**: Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.
- <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">**Woe (Odd)**</span>: Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 10: Twinkling Constellations</span>

The constellations of your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Starry Form</span> improve. The 1d8 of the <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Archer</span> and the <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Chalice</span> becomes 2d8, and while the <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Dragon</span> is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Starry Form</span>, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 14: Full of Stars</span>

While in your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Starry Form</span>, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
