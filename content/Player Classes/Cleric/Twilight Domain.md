> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Turn the night into comfort.</span>*

The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but of the [[Talasyl|deity of twilight]] guards against the horrors of the night. Clerics who serve them bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.
