> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Call on the power of the heavens.</span>*

Your pact draws on the power of Celestials from the [[Outer Planes]]. You might enter an agreement with an [[Angels|angel]], a [[Phoenixes|phoenix]], a [[Hollyphants|hollyphant]], or some similar entity associated with those realms. Or you might call on numerous such beings as you pursue goals aligned with theirs. Your pact allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.

### Mechanical Traits
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Celestial Spells</span>

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a [[Warlock]] level specified in the Celestial Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3             | [[Aid]], [[Cure Wounds]], [[Guiding Bolt]], [[Lesser Restoration]], [[Light]], [[Sacred Flame]] |
| 5             | [[Daylight]], [[Revivify]]                                                                      |
| 7             | [[Guardian of Faith]], [[Wall of Fire]]                                                         |
| 9             | [[Greater Restoration]], [[Summon Celestial]]                                                   |
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Healing Light</span>

You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 plus your Warlock level.

As a Bonus Action, you can heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, and restore a umber of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 6: Radiant Soul</span>

Your link to your patron allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have Resistance to Radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals Radiant or Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one Radiant or Fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 10: Celestial Resilience</span>

You gain Temporary Hit Points whenever you use your [[Magical Cunning]] feature or finish a Short Rest or Long Rest. These Temporary Hit Points equal your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 14: Searing Vengeance</span>

The radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain Hit Points equal to half your Hit Point Maximum and then stand if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the [[Blinded]] condition until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
