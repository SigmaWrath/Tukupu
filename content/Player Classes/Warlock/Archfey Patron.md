Your pact draws on the power of the [[Feywild]], the mysterious realm of the Fey. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with a single mighty [[Archfey|archfey]]. Or you might call on a wide spectrum of Fey, forging a complex web of favors and debts. Your patron’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges.

### Mechanical Traits

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Archfey Spells</span>

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a [[Warlock]] level specified in the table below, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3             | [[Calm Emotions]], [[Faerie Fire]], [[Misty Step]], [[Phantasmal Force]], [[Sleep]] |
| 5             | [[Blink]], [[Plant Growth]]                                                         |
| 7             | [[Dominate Beast]], [[Greater Invisibility]]                                        |
| 9             | [[Dominate Person]], [[Seeming]]                                                    |
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Steps of the Fey</span> 
Your patron bestows on you the ability to move between the boundaries of the [[Planes|planes]]. You can cast [[Misty Step]] without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Refreshing Step</span>**: Immediately after you teleport, one creature you can see within 10 feet of you gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Taunting Step</span>**: Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 6: Misty Escape</span> 
You can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. You can cast [[Misty Step]] as a Reaction in response to taking damage. In addition, the following effects are now among your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Steps of the Fey</span> options.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Disappearing Step</span>**: You have the [[Invisible]] condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll or cast a spell.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Dreadful Step</span>**: Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 10: Beguiling Defenses</span> 
Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [[Charmed]] condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take.

Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a spell slot when you use it again.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 14: Bewitching Magic</span>

Your patron bestows on you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [[Misty Step]] as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
