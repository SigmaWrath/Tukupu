Unlike [[Wizard|wizards]], who learn their magic through the study of books and ancient tomes, or [[Warlock|warlocks]] and [[Cleric|clerics]], who get their powers by the will of a higher and powerful entity, witches summon spirits from the [[Ethereal Plane]] to use their power.

This vast and ever-changing oral tradition is called witchcraft, and it can only be taught by a powerful witch.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Becoming a Witch</span>
When an extremely accomplished witch takes an apprentice, that pupil is then trained in the art of witchcraft. Witches use their own bodies as the conduit for magic, so pupils seeking to become witches must train their bodies to withstand the effects of a spirit's magic, as well as learn the oral tradition of witchcraft through spells and practices.

When they are ready, the apprentice forms a pact with their mentor, called a **<span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">Covenant</span>**. The covenant is what allows the witch to channel, command, and give form to the magical energy of spirits.

The covenant changes the very essence of a witch, rendering their entire body magical. This pact between pupil and mentor is represented by a **<span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">Witchmark</span>**, a physical mark on a witch's body which appears once a covenant is made. Each mentor's covenant is different and, as such, witch-marks vary wildly depending on who mentored the witch. Some witchmarks may look like vines and leaves, others like chains that spiral around a witch's arms, or perhaps like scripture that extends along the witch's back, among countless other forms. It's not uncommon for witchmarks to move on their own along the witch's body as they cast spells and grow more powerful.

Because witchcraft is an oral tradition, and because each witch trains under a unique mentor, witches are incredibly different from one another. Some witches focus purely on spellcasting, while others focus on enhancing their bodies with magic to fight. Two witches trained under two different mentors will each have a witchmark, use spirits as a source for their power, and be tied to their masters by a covenant, but the similarities end there. One witch could be a scheming spellcaster who inflicts debuffs on the enemy, whereas another might use their magic to amplify their own strength and wield a battle axe with even more power.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Witch Culture</span>

Losing one's covenant is considered the highest form of dishonor among witches. A witch without a covenant loses their witchmark, their ability to contact spirits, and their capability of using magic. This effectively strips them of their title as a witch. A covenant can only be broken by a witch's mentor, not by the witch themselves, but at the same time the only way for a witch to not have a mentor and still remain a witch is for their mentor to die. This has led to a sort of balance among witches: if a witch is ruthless and evil they might lose their covenant, but if a mentor is abusive and cruel they might meet their demise at the hands of their own apprentice. As an oral tradition passed from one witch to another, witchcraft needs witches to continue taking in apprentices and forming covenants to keep the tradition, and therefore their own magic, alive. The system therefore remains generally in balance, although it's not unheard of for a particularly evil and selfish witch to kill their master to not risk losing their covenant, causing chaos and plunging themselves and other witches into ruin.

Because witches are inherently diverse as a group, there are no rules that govern all witches, but patterns emerge everywhere witchcraft is practiced. Communities where experienced witches and witches-in-training congregate to share knowledge are common, and are usually referred to as <span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">**Covens**</span>. A coven can be anything from a family unit that keeps their particular familial form of witchcraft alive, to a group of socialite witches who convene in incense-thick salons to discuss the latest in potions and spells, to a renowned school where covenants are gated behind complex qualifying exams.

Not all witches belong to covens; some have only their mentor as company, and some have lost their mentor a long time ago. While some of these covenless witches live in bustling cities selling their talents for witchcraft to the general public, others choose to live in isolation, whether alone or with their master. Witches without a coven are often called <span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">hedgewitches</span>, a term that can be used in a neutral way or pejoratively, depending on the speaker's opinion.
