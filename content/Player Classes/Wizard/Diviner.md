The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

### Mechanical Traits

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Divination Savant</span>
Choose two [[Wizard]] spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 3: Portent</span>
Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any d20 Test made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 6: Expert Divination</span>
Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell of level 2 or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than level 5.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 10: The Third Eye</span>
You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a Short Rest or Long Rest. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest.

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Darkvision</span>**: You gain [[Darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Greater Comprehension</span>**: You can read any language.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">See Invisibility</span>**: You can cast [[See Invisibility]] without expending a spell slot.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Level 14: Greater Portent</span>
The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Portent</span> feature rather than two.
