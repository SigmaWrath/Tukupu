> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Naltor, also known as the Dream Realm, is the [[Outer Planes|outer plane]] that embodies dreams as the interaction between thought and reality.</span>*

Naltor is located between <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Cardinal Moon</span> and <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Cardinal Stars</span>. It is accessible from adjacent outer planes <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(the [[Court of Stars]] and [[Houses of Night]])</span> via [[Oceanus]] flowing through <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Maeve</span>. Naltor is also accessible via the [[Stargrave]] from the [[Astral Plane|Astral Sea]]. A skilled [[Dreamer]] can travel to Naltor <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(and between its layers)</span> via sleep. 

Naltor has three layers: <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Maeve</span>, <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Nia</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Nura</span>. They have varying topology and physical characteristics.
###### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Maeve - The Lucid Omens</span>
Maeve is the surface, uppermost layer of Naltor. It resembles a vast world often shrouded in night, illuminated by soft starlight, glowing mists, and the luminescent flora that grow in its dream-charged soil. Many fauna are capable of using raw dream energy or psychic manifestations of it. The landscape constantly, slowly shifts in subtle ways, but always stays more or less the same. In moments of "urgency", the sky sometimes becomes stark white, and colors appear slightly bleached. 

If they seek them, most travelers will be able to find creature comforts via sheer hope. Settlements, if they can be called that, are often impermanent, as structures dissolve when the dreamers who created them move on.

[[Unicorns]] originate from Maeve, their existence deeply tied to the raw dream-energy that permeates the realm. They roam freely, and are typically encountered as guides to lost travelers or guardians of particularly powerful dream sites. 

###### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Nia - The Dream Expanse</span>
Nia is the middle layer of Naltor and the most stable. It is a surreal expanse of spiraling cones of bluish ice hues <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(called [[Kanohi]], they resemble giant [[Unicorns|unicorn]] horns)</span>, each acting as a conduit for dreams across the multiverse. These large formations display dream-images on their surfaces, which shift continuously as new dreams take hold and old ones fade. A thin layer of fog runs across the ground, which is smooth and reflective of the Kanohi. The backdrop of the world is black.

At the heart of Nia stands the [[Dream Totem]], an enigmatic structure believed to be the core of Nia's power, holding the essence of dreams and channeling the collective unconscious of all dreamers. Those who approach the Totem often experience visions, which can range from historical memories to prophetic dreams to glimpses into other timelines.


###### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Nura - The Nightmare Realm</span>
Nura is the deepest and most dangerous layer of Naltor, where the separation between thought and reality collapses entirely. Here, stray ideas and emotions can take form with terrifying immediacy. A travelerâ€™s stray fear might summon a nightmare predator; a moment of longing could create an illusory paradise that ensnares the mind.

Time and space are meaningless in Nura. Those who venture too deeply risk becoming trapped in a cycle of dreams, unable to discern whether they are awake, asleep, or something else entirely. Some believe that Nura is the source of all dreams, the primordial sea from which imagination itself flows. Others warn that it is the place where forgotten dreams, abandoned thoughts, and unrealized nightmares fester, waiting for the moment to return to reality.

> Dreams take in vast subconscious input and distill it into a singular symbolic experience, compressing, condensing, and unifying disparate thoughts.
