The [[Vesperia|Material Plane]] can be considered the "root" plane from which other planes stem. 

There are three broad categories of planes connected <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(directly or indirectly)</span> to the Material Plane:
- [[Inner Planes]]
- [[Transitive Planes]]
- [[Outer Planes]]

There are also the [[Far Realms]], which are entirely inaccessible by all except for [[Deities]].
