> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Unreachable [[Planes|planes]] with potentially alien laws of physics.</span>*

The Far Realms are infinite in number and are <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(for the most part)</span> entirely inaccessible by all except for [[Deities]]. 

The vast majority of the Far Realms have laws of physics completely different to that of the [[Inner Planes|inner planes]], which would prevent creatures from traveling there as they wouldn't be able to exist. These kinds of realms are called [[Bizarre Realms]].

Some of the Far Realms are believed to have similar enough laws of physics to the [[Inner Planes|inner planes]] that existence there would be possible. However, travel there is nigh impossible as the [[The Lovers|Lovers]] haven't connected them to any reachable planes. These planes are thus called [[Unconnected Realms]]. If they were to be connected, Unconnected Realms would be [[Outer Planes|outer planes]]. It has been confirmed to [[Argenta]] by [[Helionne]] themself that the [[Wildsea]] was once <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(very, very long ago)</span> amongst the [[Unconnected Realms]]. 

Realms that are considered "connected" occur because stable connection is facilitated by the [[The Lovers|Lovers]]. However, energy fluctuations can create transient connections through which entities from the Far Realms can "leak" into connected planes. This is where <span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">**Aberrations**</span> come from.
