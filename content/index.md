> This is a setting compiled and partially written by <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Sumrath Kaur</span>. It's based primarily upon [2024 D&D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules) and takes inspiration from the [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). It also references the [Wildsea RPG](https://www.myth.works/en-ca/collections/the-wildsea-homepage) by [Felix Issacs](https://felixisaacs.itch.io/). It incorporates ideas from [Connie Chang](https://bsky.app/profile/byconniechang.bsky.social) of [Transplanar RPG](https://transplanarrpg.com/) and [Antonio Demico](https://linktr.ee/antodemico) of [Pointy Hat](https://www.youtube.com/@pointyhatstudios), as well as ideas from several anonymous minds encountered in the depths of internet forums.
