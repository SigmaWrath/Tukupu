> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Orcs are hardy wanderers, shaped by endless horizons and shadowed depths, carrying strong will in their hearts.</span>*

Orcs were created for the [[Vesperia|Material Plane]] by [[The Lovers]] with gifts to help them wander great plains, vast caverns, and churning seas and to face the dangers that lurk there. They possess great endurance, determination, and the ability to see in darkness.

Ores are, on average, tall and broad. They have skin ranging from grey to green, ears that are sharply pointed, and prominent lower canines that resemble small tusks. Orc youths on some worlds are told about their ancestors' great travels and travails. Inspired by those tales, many of those orcs wonder when fate will call on them to match the heroic deeds of old. Other ores are happy to leave old tales in the past and find their own way.

Orcs tend to be about 6-7 feet tall, and live up to 80 years old.
