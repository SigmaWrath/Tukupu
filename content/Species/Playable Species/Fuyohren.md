> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Born and nurtured on gentle flowing rivers and tranquil ponds, the fuyohren are sentient, mobile plants innately harmonious with the natural world.</span>* 

### Overview

Fuyohren societies nestle within ecosystems effortlessly, acting in synchronicity with the ebb and flow of the world around them. A society might exist on the same plot of land for millennia, yet remain undetectable to outsiders who pass through, with nary a tree uprooted or stone upturned to indicate the fuyohren's presence.

Fuyohren can grow up to 6 feet tall. They reach adulthood at 18, and can live up to 150 years old.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Seasonal Divination</span>

Bound to nature, the fuyohren bear an imprint of the world at the time of their birth. So-called "winter warriors" are fuyohren born in the bitter, colder months, and are believed to bear an aggressive, steely disposition. Fuyohren born in spring are blessed with a childlike, optimistic disposition, while summer fuyohren are typically charismatic, and au-cumnal fuyohren said to be wise. Whether these stereotypes are true or merely a product of a cultural myth manifesting irself in the way fuyohren are raised is unknown.

##### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Kaiju Callers</span>

[[Kaiju]] are feared and worshipped by the fuyohren for their power to obliterate swathes of an environment through their presence alone. Many fuyohren cultural traditions include dances, festivals, and ceremonies which aim to placate such behemoths. Bolder fuyohren may actively seek rampaging kaiju, drawing them away from societies and fragile ecosystems and into the untamed wilderness, usually at the cost of their own lives. Kaiju that do not interfere with the natural world are revered by the fuyohren, while chaotic beings of wanton destructive force are hated and feared.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Fluid Motion</span>**: You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Restrained]], [[Paralyzed]], or [[Petrified]] condition on yourself.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Graceful Step</span>**: You can move across any fluid surface-such as water, mud, snow, or quicksand as if it were solid ground. However, you are not protected from the damaging effects of contact with dangerous liquids, like lava or acid.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Water Magic</span>**: Through a 10 minute ritual, you can imbue a vial of ordinary water with magical properties. Choose one of the following effects:

- ﻿﻿The water gains the magical properties of holy water
- ﻿﻿The water becomes a simple antidote that ends the [[Poisoned]] condition when drunk by one creature
- ﻿﻿The water is imbued with vitality. Drinking the vial is enough liquid to hydrate a Large or smaller creature for 24 hours
- ﻿﻿The water bubbles with healing magic. A creature who ingests the vial of water regains 1d4 Hit Points

The water remains potent for the next 24 hours, after which time it returns to normal. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
