> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Jinxes are cursed variants of [[halflings]], doomed to attract misfortune wherever they go.</span>*

### Overview
Nobody knows what jinxes did to deserve their fate. Some say that when halfling parents give birth to a jinx, they are being punished for breaking an important law of goodness and hospitality. Some believe that they were created to make up for the lucky halflings, so that the cosmic scale of fate remains in balance. Whatever the case may be, the reality is that jinxes naturally attract misfortune wherever they go.

It matters little what a jinx does to try to offset their fate; they are constantly followed by a streak of bad luck. A jinx attending any function will ensure that it will rain that day; a wagon will mysteriously break down if a jinx is traveling on it; hosting a jinx in your home will lead to rats finding their way into your pantry and a leak to form in your roof.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Isolation</span>
These mishaps influence the way that jinxes go through life. There is no jinx society, as any concentration of jinxes in the same place tends to have terrible consequences for anyone around them. There are no jinx family units, as it’s generally frowned upon even among jinxes to form a relationship with another jinx, and children leave their parents behind in their teens, when their bad luck starts to manifest. They are naturally nomadic, not just to not curse the same place with their misfortune for long, but also because they are simply not welcomed by others, and for regrettably good reason. 
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Appearance</span>
The jinx’s distinctive looks make it easy for them to be spotted and shunned. They stand around 3 feet tall, like other halflings, but that’s where the similarities end. Their appearance is only in shades of gray, black, or stark white, as if color had been sapped from them along with their luck. The dark rings around their eyes seem to be indelible, no matter how much sleep they get, and the tips of their fingers are always slightly darker than the rest of their skin, bruised up from all of their bad luck.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Outlook</span>
Faced with this unfortunate existence, jinxes go through life in many different ways. Since they are nomadic by necessity, many take on adventuring, as it’s one of the few professions that can benefit from bad luck -- after all, the jinx’s misfortune can just as easily affect those the jinx is fighting. Some jinxes decide to rebel against their cruel fate, and try to find a way to free themselves and their brethren from their curse in their travels, keeping a happy and positive attitude even in the face of constant misfortune.

Some others, however, embrace their bad luck and see it as a gift. There are whispers of guilds of jinxes that disguise their members and send them to the houses of their targets. They gain employment as servants, or befriend them and are invited as guests, and then they just need to stay there long enough for their natural gift to do its work. The string of bad luck will soon follow and fall upon the house they have infiltrated. It is said that countless individuals with great potential have been ruined by a jealous rival hiring the services of a jinx guild.

### Mechanical Traits

| Creature Type | Size  | Speed |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Humanoid      | Small | 30 ft |
_**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Halfling Nimbleness</span>:**_ You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can’t stop in the same space.

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Unalluring</span>***: You have advantage on saving throws against being [[Charmed]].

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Unremarkable</span>***: Your grayscale appearance and your small size allow you to blend in with the shadows. You have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in [[darkness]] or [[dim light]]. Additionally, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action. You can take the Hide action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

<span style="color:rgb(192, 82, 75)">***Jinx***</span>: You are naturally unlucky, which affects you and anyone around you, friend or foe. At the end of each long rest, the GM rolls a d100 on the table below to find out the effects of your bad luck. If the GM feels like the effect rolled is unlikely to happen within that day, they roll again. The GM then selects who or what is the target of your bad luck, and when the effect takes place. The effects of your bad luck can affect any creature (including you) or any object within 100 feet of you. The GM should evenly distribute the effects of your bad luck between you, your party, and NPCs (including enemies) within that 100 feet radius. Once the effect has taken place, you gain the ability to impose disadvantage on any dice roll, even those related to abilities or effects you are not aware of, provided the creature affected by the disadvantage is within 100 feet of you. Once you’ve imposed this disadvantage, the GM rolls on the table again, and so on.

At the end of a long rest, any effects that have not yet taken place, including your ability to impose disadvantage, are discarded and the GM rolls on the table again.
