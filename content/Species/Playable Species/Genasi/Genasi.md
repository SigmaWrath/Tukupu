> <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Genasi are created when [[humans]] are touched by powerful magic, be it primordial or arcane. They carry aspects of this magic with them.</span>


| Two Broad Categories of Genasi |
| ------------------------------ |
| [[Elemental Genasi]]           |
| [[Spellborn Genasi]]           |

The most common of the genasi are the [[Elemental Genasi|elemental genasi]], but arcanists don’t call them by this name. In academic circles that study the arcane, these are referred to instead as “<span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">evocation-born</span>”. They are common because of the influence of the [[Planes|planes]], and genies meddling in mortal lives, but <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">arcaneborn of different schools</span> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(collectively referred to as [[Spellborn Genasi|spellborn genasi]])</span> *are* very much possible, albeit much rarer. 

Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.
