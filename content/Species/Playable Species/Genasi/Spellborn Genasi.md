> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">*Spellborn [[genasi]] are born from exposure to powerful magic outside of a specific element.*</span>

#### Overview
The birth of an [[Genasi|arcaneborn]] not tied to a specific element is much rarer because it can only happen due to acute exposure to what is commonly referred as “grand magic.” Magic that changes the fabric of reality, magic that bends the Weave with such force that the ripples it leaves behind influence the lives of those close to the casting for generations; what mages would qualify as above 9th level.

Just like some evocation-born present with glowing lines pulsing with evocation magic, other arcaneborn can bear these glowing lines. Because arcaneborn are born from exposure to grand magic, though, these lines manifest instead as the spell formulas of the spell that made them arcaneborn in the first place. Their skin glows with the text of the spell in question or the magic circles and runes that were used during the casting process. Some arcaneborn have been used as living spell scrolls because of this feature, becoming guardians of specific spells and testing [[Wizard|wizards]] who wish to learn the magic that shines through their skin.

Arcaneborn are also affected by the components used to cast the spells. Somatic components can manifest in the arms, hands, and even feet of the arcaneborn, giving them an eerie arcane glow or changing them even more dramatically; verbal components grant the plane-touched an unearthly, magical voice; and material components might even manifest as arcane echoes around the arcaneborn. An arcaneborn born of a spell that used flowers in its casting might manifest those same flowers around themselves as a reflection of the spell that made them an arcaneborn.

The different arcaneborn that are born from the casting of this spell are aligned to the school of magic of the spell that was cast.
### Mechanical Traits

| Humanoid      | Medium or Small | 30 ft |
***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Darkvision</span>***: You have [[Darkvision]] with a range of 120 feet.

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Arcane Imprint</span>***: Magic has left an indelible mark on you. Choose one of the following benefits, corresponding to the school of magic of the spell that left an imprint on you, as an arcane boon from your exposure to the highest levels of magic.

- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Abjuration</span>**: You have resistance to Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage, chosen at the end of a Long Rest. Additionally, you gain +1 to your base Armor Class.
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Conjuration</span>**: You treat a weapon with the Two-Handed property as a one-handed weapon, and you can perform somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Enchantment</span>**: You have Advantage on saving throws against being [[Charmed]], and when you spend an Action or Bonus Action to inflict a Charm effect on a creature, you can impose Disadvantage on that creature's saving throw against the Charm effect as part of that Action or Bonus Action. You can impose this Disadvantage a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain all expended uses of this trait when you finish a Long Rest.
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Illusion</span>**: You have Advantage on all skill or ability checks to see through illusions. Additionally, you are unremarkable; people cannot remember details about you such as your physical appearance or general build. They *can* remember your dress and your actions.
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Necromancy</span>**: You have resistance to Necrotic damage. You instinctively know if a creature you can see is undead. Additionally, you have Advantage on the first Saving Throw you roll after completing a Long Rest. You regain this Advantage at the end of a Long Rest.

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Spellbound</span>***: Depending on your <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Arcane Imprint</span>, you inherently know how to cast a set of specific spells. When you choose an <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Arcane Imprint</span>, you gain the level 1 benefit of the chosen imprint in the table below. When you reach character levels 3 and 4, you learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spell-casting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the imprint).
