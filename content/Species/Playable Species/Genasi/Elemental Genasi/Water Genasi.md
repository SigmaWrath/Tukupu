> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Water [[Genasi]] are [[Elemental Genasi|elemental genasi]] descended from [[marids]], who are the aquatic [[genies]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves. The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—all of these things call to their heart. They wander freely, taking pride in their independence. </span>*

A water genasi's skin is often a shade of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.
