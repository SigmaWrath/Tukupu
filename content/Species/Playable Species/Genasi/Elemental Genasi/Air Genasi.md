> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Air [[Genasi]] are [[Elemental Genasi|elemental genasi]] descended from [[djinn]], who are the [[genies]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. Embodying many of the airy traits of their otherworldly ancestors, air genasi can draw upon their connection to the winds. As changeable as the weather, their moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.</span>*

Air genasi’s skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts. Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish-white energy spilling out. An air genasi’s hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo.
