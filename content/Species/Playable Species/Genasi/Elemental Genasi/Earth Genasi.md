> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Tracing their ancestry to [[dao]], the [[genies]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], earth [[Genasi]] are [[Elemental Genasi|elemental genasi]] who inherit dao’s steadfast strength and control over earth. They have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. They tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.</span>*

An earth genasi’s skin can be the colors of stone and earth or a human skin tone with glittering sparkles like gem dust. Some earth genasi have lines marking their skin like cracks, either showing glimmering gemlike veins or a dim, yellowish glow. Earth genasi hair can appear carved of stone or crystal or resemble strands of spun metal.
