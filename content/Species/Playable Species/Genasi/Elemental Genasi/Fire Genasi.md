> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">*Descended from [[efreet]], the [[genies]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], fire [[Genasi]] are [[Elemental Genasi|elemental genasi]] who channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. Fire genasi have inherited the volatile mood of their element, and have keen minds, but tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide their distinctive appearance, they exult in it.* </span>

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some fire genasi bear skin tones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while some sport actual flames dancing on their heads.  Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.
