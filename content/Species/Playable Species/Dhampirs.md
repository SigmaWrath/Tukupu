> <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Often descended from [[Vampires|vampires]], a dhampir's existence is defined by hunger and desire. </span>

Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. Those who overindulge their thirst risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress them through constant, molar-grinding restraint. In any case, temptation haunts dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give them endless reasons to indulge.

While many dhampirs thirst for blood, they might otherwise gain sustenance from the living.

Dhampirs are most often the child of a [[Vampires|vampire]] and some Humanoid, but plenty of other circumstances might have transformed a dhampir. Perhaps a pact with a predatory fiend, fey, or spirit causes you to share their hunger. Maybe a radical experiment changed their body, making them reliant on others for vital fluids.
