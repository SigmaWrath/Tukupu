> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">*Ardlings are beast-like humanoids imbued with the magic of the [[Beastlands]].*</span>

Celestial animals roam the [[Beastlands]], a plane of untamed beauty and wild nature. Many of those otherworldly animals serve the [[Beast Lords]]. Many Ardlings are descended from these celestial animals, and some are descended directly from the Beast Lords themselves from their affairs with mortals. A rare few were simply given a blessing by Beast Lord before birth. 

Ardlings are people with beast-like features, keen senses, and an innate connection to divine magic. Depending on their Beast Lord ancestor, the Ardling might have fur, feathers, or scales. Some little and others hulking, Ardlings are as varied as the animals they resemble. 

Ardlings live up to 200 years.
