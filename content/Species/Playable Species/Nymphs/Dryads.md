> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">**<u>Note</u>**: the subspecies that are presented above provide categories that are more or less universal, and can be reskinned to almost any kind of tree. For example, if a player wants to play a Meliae (honey nymph), that can be reskinned as a Cherry dryad. </span>
