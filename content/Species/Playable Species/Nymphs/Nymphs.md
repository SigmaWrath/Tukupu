> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Nymphs are embodiments of nature, manifesting the raw beauty, vitality, and spirit of the wild places they call home. They are immensely varied depending on the aspect of nature they embody. While they are #Fey, they are born from directly from nature in both the [[Feywild]] and the [[Vesperia|Material Plane]].</span>* 

Nymphs nearly always share kinship with [[kami]], and work alongside these powerful spirits protect nature and maintain the delicate harmony of the wild.

There are many different kinds of nymphs.
