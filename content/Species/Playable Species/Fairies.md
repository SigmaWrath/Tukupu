> <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Fairies are deeply tied to the magic of the [[Feywild]], embodying the untamed whimsy and wonder of that enchanted realm. Born from the wild essence of nature and infused with trickster magic, they flit between worlds on insectile wings, drawn to places of beauty and mystery.</span>

Most fairies look like Small [[Elves|elves]] with insectile wings, but each has some feature that makes them special. Their skin might shimmer with an iridescent sheen, reflecting hues of soft pastels or deep twilight shades. Some have delicate, moth-like patterns across their skin, while others glow faintly like fireflies in the dark. They may smell like fresh brownies, have insectile legs, or be surrounding by glittering mist or a slight chill. A fairy’s wings can range from gossamer dragonfly filaments to velvety butterfly sails. 

Fairies have a life span of about a century. They range from 3 to 4 feet tall, and about 30 to 40 lbs.
##### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Humanoid Misunderstandings</span>

Humanoid species historically had several defining encounters with fairies, which resulted in two different names for them:
###### <span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Pixies</span>
When humanoids encountered fairies without breaking fey moral codes, they received a relatively pleasant response. Those humanoids called the fairies they encountered <span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">pixies</span>.

> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce themselves and strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh.</span>
> 
> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Pixies array themselves like royalty of the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond. Some dress in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride in their regalia and beam with joy when they are complimented on their ensembles.</span>

###### <span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Sprites</span>
When humanoids encountered fairies and broke fey moral codes, they received a hostile response. Those humanoids called the fairies they encountered <span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">sprites</span>.

> <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">In secret groves and shaded glens, small sprites flutter about. For all their fey splendor, however, sprites lack warmth and compassion. They are aggressive and hardy warriors, taking severe measures to ward strangers away from their homes. Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.</span>

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Fey</span>***: Your creature type is Fey. You cannot be [[Charmed]] or put to [[Sleep]] against your will. 

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">*Fairy Magic*</span>**: You know the [[Druidcraft]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Faerie Fire]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Enlarge—Reduce|Enlarge/Reduce]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast [[Faerie Fire]] or [[Enlarge—Reduce|Enlarge/Reduce]] with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this species).

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Flight</span>***: Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.
