> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Descended from [[Giants|giants]], goliaths are towering humanoids who thrive in the harsh mountain peaks where survival demands strength, self-sufficiency, and an unyielding will to surpass their own limits.</span>*

### Overview
Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. They average 7 to 8 feet tall. Their skin tones range from gray to brown to pale blue (depending on their giant heritage), and their bodies look like they are carved from stone and give them great physical power. One of the most distinctive features of the goliath are the darker (often vertically symmetrical) patches of skin that cover their entire bodies. Goliaths believe that these markings somehow explain or control their fate or destiny. For this reason, goliaths never tattoo themselves as this could affect their future.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Values</span>
Goliaths' most notable characteristic is their competitiveness. Goliaths keep track of their accomplishments and see everything as a challenge. But a goliath's most fierce competitor is themself. Beating their own records is the most satisfying victory for a goliath.

For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, resources, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other.  Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains. 

This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between common and ruling classes in some societies puzzles goliaths. If a leader lacks the intelligence or ability to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the society should take their place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power.

Complacency is a trait that goliaths loath and as a result they never take anything for granted. Even goliaths with magical advantages might continue to train their physical prowess in case they ever lost their power. Goliaths have little time for cheaters, gloaters, and sore losers. They never hold grudges if they lose a fair fight, and often repeat the goliath maxim that, "Today's rival is tomorrow's teammate." 

The competitive nature of goliaths meant that the attitude and achievements of one would quickly inspire the whole tribe. Individuals within tribes would constantly be trying to outdo each other's good deeds. This meant that nearby settlements often stereotyped goliaths as a heroic and good people. 

Their constant comparison to their past accomplishments can be hard on goliaths that fail to meet goals or measure up to achievements of the past— they may be dissatisfied with anything that doesn't surpass a victory from their past. This unfortunate element of goliath psychology has led many older goliaths to be very unhappy with themselves when they could no longer perform as well as they could in their youth. 

Goliath adventurers have rarely retired or lived to an old age, as they often died trying to surpass their previous achievements. Permanently injured or aging goliaths have often sought death in battle rather than succumb to an existence where they could not excel.

Trust and honor are the key aspects of most goliaths. Goliaths are also notably daring and fearless. Feats of physical strength and agility, like jumping chasms or climbing cliffs, hold no fear for goliaths. Goliaths are naturally curious beings and love to explore.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Combat</span>
Goliath tribes only go to war as a final option, preferring to move away from unsafe lands. They do not do this out of fear or cowardice, instead they are aware that loss of life in their tribe is undesirable and has long-term consequences.

If forced to go to war, however, a tribe would do so without fear. Circumstances that might force a tribe include being cornered or having members of their tribe kidnapped. Once weapons were distributed and war-captains were chosen, a goliath tribe could quickly become a very capable war-band. Goliaths are always at the peak of their physical condition and their fine-tuned hunting skills made them competent warriors at a moment's notice.

All adult goliaths fight in times of war. Only children and infants were expected not to fight.

Hide or leather armor are favored by goliaths as they already have naturally durable bodies and do not like to restrict their movement. Goliaths often use large two-handed weapons to make the most of their considerable strength.

Goliaths have often employed guerrilla tactics in battle, owing to their upbringing as hunters. Fair-play is also integral to goliath fights. As long as they're fairly sure they could still win, goliaths would even handicap themselves to give their opponents a fair chance. For example, if a goliath disarmed their opponent, they would throw aside their own weapon and continue the fight with their fists.

As with their recreational sports, goliaths seriously frown upon "cheating" in battle. Finishing off a fallen foe, taking hostages, and attacking civilians is considered distasteful and unfair.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Tribes</span> 
Goliaths live in small tribes that numbered between forty and sixty goliaths. These are usually made up of three to five extended families. Most goliaths live in the same tribe their entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge together.

Goliath tribes have a number of key roles that are filled by the most capable members. Summaries of these roles are included below:

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Chieftain</span>

The primary authority figure in a tribe. The chieftain is responsible for choosing when the tribe should move on to new lands. The chieftain also chooses who fills some of the other key roles in the tribe.

Tribe chieftains only maintain power as long as they can prove they were suitable for that role. As a result, leadership changes with relative frequency (on average every 5 years). New leaders are chosen by contests. Any goliath could challenge the chieftain in an attempt to replace them. If this happened, the chieftain and the challenger competed in three tasks. The challenger had to win all three to become the new chieftain. The old chieftain would step down.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Captain</span>

Two captains are assigned to each of the important jobs each morning. These jobs include hunting, gathering, cooking, and scouting. The captains then build up their own teams and set out to achieve their task. Two captains are assigned to each task to encourage healthy rivalry.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Skywatcher</span>

Often the most experienced [[Druid]] or [[shaman]] <span style="color:rgb(186, 74, 120)">(shaman = witch druid)</span> of the tribe. Skywatchers make sure that resources aren't over harvested and game animals aren't needlessly slaughtered. Skywatchers are often exempt from the teams that the captains assembles each morning. Skywatchers also oversee festivals, rituals, and celebrations.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Dawncaller</span>

Responsible for guarding the camp overnight and alerting the tribe if there's trouble. At dawn, they sing or bellow tales of goliath bravery or heroics to wake everyone up. Dawncallers are assigned daily and given less work throughout the day so they can rest and be alert at night.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Adjudicator</span> 

Adjudicators settle disputes. Unless urgent, an adjudicator hears disputes after the evening meal. Tough decisions are often settled with a contest of the adjudicator's devising. If a goliath appealed against an adjudicator's decision, the chieftain would have to settle the dispute, but would also have to dismiss the adjudicator from their position. Adjudicators also act as referees for sports.

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Kinkeeper</span>

Chosen by the chieftain each morning, the kinkeeper was responsible for care and teaching of the tribe's infants and toddlers, as their parents were often busy with other responsibilities. If there's an infant in the clan, the kinkeeper must also be able to be a wet nurse. Kinkeepers also decide when young goliaths are old enough to start contributing to the tribe (usually around the age of 10).

###### <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Lamentor</span>  

Responsible for determining when a member of the tribe is permanently unable to make positive contributions the tribe. Good lamentors then approach the individual to explain their decision and consult the chieftain. Once it has been decided, the lamentor prepares a long chant to commemorate the goliath, before the tribe exiles the old or weak individual from the tribe.

#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Names</span>
Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are *at least* three syllables, and end in a vowel. Names aren't gendered. 

A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds.

Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Arts</span>
Arts and crafting in goliath culture are limited by the resources they have at hand in the mountains. As a result, goliaths are skilled in crafts like flintknapping, tanning, stitching, simple pottery, bone-carving, and painting.

Goliath art is often colorful and expressive. Art is one of the few things that goliaths understand to be non-competitive; they fully appreciate that art can't have a winner. Goliaths believe that art should be used to show people something they can't see in the real world. Goliaths decorate their tents, caves, weapons, and clothes with abstract designs (often jagged, parallel lines and symbols that had astronomical significance). They also often painted ceramics, tents, and caves with designs that reflected natural landscapes and local geography. 

Goliath music relies heavily on percussion, deep vocal chanting, and the rhythmic use of natural elements like stones, bones, and wooden drums. Their songs are often powerful and resonant, carrying over great distances in the thin mountain air.
#### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">Leisure</span>
Goliaths often play sports to improve their physical skills and pass time. Simple games include climbing, sprinting, and wrestling.

Other games that were popular amongst many tribes included:

- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Goat-ball</span>:** This involves the use of a stuffed goat hide, which is tossed around by two teams (usually four a side). The two teams jump around on several raised platforms (usually rocks or logs) trying to pass, intercept, and hit each other with the goat-ball. Any participants that are hit by the goat-ball are out of the game. Participants who fall or are knocked from their platform are also out. One team loses once all their players are out.
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Stubborn-root</span>:** One goliath is chosen to be the "root" and has to defend a ridge or peak from the other competitors (similar to king of the mountain, played by children in towns and cities).
- **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Cliff-climb</span>:** A simple cliff-climbing race. Most races involve climbing up a cliff and then climbing back down. Participants can choose to fall part of the way on the return climb to save time, but risk injuring themselves. The winner is often the best of three races. Particularly skilled climbers often handicap themselves by wearing backpacks full of stones.
