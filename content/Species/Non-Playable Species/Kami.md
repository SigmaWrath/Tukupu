> <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Kami are spirits of nature's power manifest, who have forms in each of the [[Parallel Planes|core planes]].</span>

Kami only generally exist in the vicinity of the natural landmark they are intertwined with (mountains, rivers, forests, fields, etc.)—this area is called their <span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">domain</span>. Natural landmarks are synchronized across the [[Parallel Planes|core planes]] by the nature of those planes, and if a kami's domain is completely destroyed in one of the core planes, the kami dies and the domain is removed from the other planes as well. 

A kami only exists in one plane at a time, but freely steps between them. Though their central identity remains unchanged, a Kami’s form and temperament shift depending on the plane:
- In the [[Feywild]], they radiate vibrant, chaotic energy, embodying nature in its most flourishing and whimsical state
- In the [[Shadowfell]], they take on a more solemn, spectral aspect, reflecting decay and doom
- On the [[Vesperia|Material Plane]], they manifest as a balanced presence, acting as the spiritual protectors of their domains

Shrines to a kami are built by mortals where the kami's presence is especially strong, and they generally manifest there physically when respectfully called upon. This will often look like a humanoid with plant or animal features <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(think foxboys)</span> and/or features signifying their domain <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">(forms of swirling water, snowcapped mountain, etc.)</span>.

Kami are to the power of nature what [[Deities|deities]] are to "the divine". The analogous word to divine, denoting something referring to the power of nature, is *<span style="color:rgb(79, 151, 125)">kami-ra</span>*. 

It is theorized that [[Akareth]] created the kami as *mental* counterparts to the *material* creation relating to the natural landmark that they are attached to, to preserve the dichotomy of her and [[Solanah]] in regards to nature. This theory holds in the context of (e.g.) mountains, but doesn't hold for, say, a river, which is under Akareth's domain. As such, there exists some debate amongst scholars.
