> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Fast Crafting</span>**. When you finish a Long Rest, you can craft one piece of gear from the Fast Crafting table, provided you have the [[Artisan's Tools]] associated with that item and have proficiency with those tools. The item lasts until you finish another Long Rest, at which point the item falls apart.
