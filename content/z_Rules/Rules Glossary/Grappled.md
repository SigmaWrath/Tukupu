While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects:

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Speed 0</span>**: Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Attacks Affected</span>:** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Movable</span>**: The grappler can drag or carry you when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes smaller than it.
