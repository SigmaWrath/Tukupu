##### *<span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">[[Paladin]] Class Feat (Level 3)</span>*

> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">You can channel divine energy through your oath, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Divine Sense</span>, which is described below.</span>* 

Other Paladin features give additional Channel Oath effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Oath, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class’s Channel Oath twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Oath effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Divine Sense</span>**: As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [[Hallow]] spell.
