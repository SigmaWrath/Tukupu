When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
