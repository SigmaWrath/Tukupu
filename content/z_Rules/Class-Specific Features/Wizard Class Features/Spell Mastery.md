Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from that book.
