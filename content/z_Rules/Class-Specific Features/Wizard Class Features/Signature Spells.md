> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you canâ€™t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.</span>*
