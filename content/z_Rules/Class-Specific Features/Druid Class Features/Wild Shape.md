As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below and [[Druid Beast Forms]]). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [[Incapacitated]] condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Number of Uses</span>**: You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Feature table.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Known Forms</span>**: You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the table below. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed                                       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 2           | 4           | 1/4    | <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">—</span> |
| 4           | 6           | 1/2    | <span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">—</span> |
| 8           | 8           | 1      | Yes                                             |
**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Rules While Shape-Shifted</span>**: While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply.

> **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Temporary Hit Points</span>**: When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Game Statistics</span>**: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving thow modifier in the Beast'stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

> **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">No Spellcasting</span>**: You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">Objects</span>**: Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.
