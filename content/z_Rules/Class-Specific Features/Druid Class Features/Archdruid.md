##### *<span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">[[Druid]] Class Feat (Level 20)</span>*

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Evergreen Wild Shape</span>**: Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of [[Wild Shape]] left, you regain one expended use of it.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Nature Magician</span>**: You can convert uses of [[Wild Shape]] into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Longevity</span>**: The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.
