##### <span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">*[[Warlock]] Class Feat (Level 1)*</span>

> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You have a number of invocations corresponding to your warlock level.</span>* 

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">_Prerequisites_</span>**: If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">_Replacing Invocations_</span>**: Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. 

When replacing or gaining an invocation, you can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.
