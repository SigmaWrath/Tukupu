When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: **[Imp](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/imp), [Pseudodragon](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/pseudodragon), [Quasit](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/quasit), [Skeleton](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/skeleton), Slaad Tadpole, Sphinx of Wonder, or [Venomous Snake](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/venomous-snake)**.  

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.
