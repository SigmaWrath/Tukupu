> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the [[Contact Other Plane]] spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.</span>*

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
