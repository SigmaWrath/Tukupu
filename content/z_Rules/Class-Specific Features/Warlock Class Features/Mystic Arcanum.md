##### <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">[[Warlock]] Class Feat (Level 11, 13, 15, 17 )</span> 

> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one spell (of the level detailed in the Warlock features table) as this arcanum.</span>* 

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.
