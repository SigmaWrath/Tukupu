> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">You are a Ranger of mythic skill. Whenever you hit your [[Ranger's Quarry|Quarry]] with a weapon attack, you can immediately end the mark and cause that attack to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.</span>* 

If the attack reduces the creature to 50 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Spell save DC or instantly be reduced to 0 hit points.
