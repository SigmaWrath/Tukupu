You can use a bonus action to mark one creature you can see as your Quarry, gaining the benefits below:

- Whenever you damage it with an attack, you deal bonus damage equal to a roll of your Quarry Die
- Whenever you make an ability check to track or locate it, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your d20 roll

These benefits last for the duration listed in the Ranger Features table. <span style="color:rgb(192, 82, 75)">They end early if your Quarry is slain or if you mark another creature as your Quarry. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot to use this feature again.</span>
