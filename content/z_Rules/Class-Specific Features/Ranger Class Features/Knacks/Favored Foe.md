Choose one creature type, two species of humanoid (such as gnolls and [[Orcs]]), or one organization (like a thieves' guild or an evil cult) as your Favored Foe.

Whenever you make a Wisdom check to hunt or track, or an Intelligence check to recall knowledge about a Favored Foe, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
