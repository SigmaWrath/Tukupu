> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">You can construct natural traps. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use a knife, natural materials, and expend 10 feet of rope to craft a Trap.</span>*

<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">As an action, you can set one of these Traps in an adjacent unoccupied 5-foot space.</span> The first Large or smaller creature to move into that space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell save DC or become restrained.

As an action, the restrained creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC, freeing the creature on a success.

<span style="color:rgb(193, 145, 56)">As an action (separate from setting the Trap), you can hide the Trap.</span> If hidden, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) against your Spell save DC is required to detect the Trap.
