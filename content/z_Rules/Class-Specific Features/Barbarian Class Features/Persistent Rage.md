> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of [[Rage]]. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</span>*

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. The Rage ends early if you have the [[Unconscious]] (not just the [[Incapacitated]] condition) or don Heavy Armor.
