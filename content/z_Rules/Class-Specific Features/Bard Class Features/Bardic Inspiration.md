#### *<span style="color:rgb(203, 123, 55)">[[Bard]] Class Feat (Level 1)</span>*

> *<span style="color:rgb(125, 125, 125)">You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which starts at a d6.</span>*

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Using Bardic Inspiration</span>**: As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when itâ€™s rolled.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Number of Uses</span>**: You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">At Higher Levels</span>***: Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.
