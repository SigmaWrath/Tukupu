Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the [[Bard Spellcasting|Bard]], [[Cleric Spellcasting|Cleric]], [[Druid Spellcasting|Druid]], and [[Wizard Spellcasting|Wizard]] spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.
