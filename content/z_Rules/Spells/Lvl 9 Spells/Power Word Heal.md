A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its Hit Points. If the creature has the [[Charmed]], [[Frightened]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Poisoned]], or [[Stunned]] condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [[Prone]] condition, it can use its Reaction to stand up.
