You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the [[Fountain of Eternity]] on the first level of the [[Beastlands]], and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the DM.  

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a [[Teleportation Circle|teleportation circle]] on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.
