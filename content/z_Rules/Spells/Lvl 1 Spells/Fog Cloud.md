You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [[Gust of Wind]]) disperses it. 

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</span>***: The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
