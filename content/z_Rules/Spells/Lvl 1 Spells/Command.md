You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Approach</span>**: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Drop</span>**: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
> 
> <span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">**Flee**</span>: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Grovel</span>**: The target has the [[Prone]] condition and then ends its turn.
> 
> **<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Halt</span>**: On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or Bonus Action.
