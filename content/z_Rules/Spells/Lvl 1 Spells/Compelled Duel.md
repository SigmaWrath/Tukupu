|Casting Time|Range|Components|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bonus Action|30 feet|V|Concentration, up to 1 minute|


You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you. 

The spell ends if you make an attack roll against a creature other than the target, if you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
