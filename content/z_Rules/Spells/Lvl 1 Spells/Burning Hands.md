A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Flammable objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried start burning. 

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</span>***: The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
