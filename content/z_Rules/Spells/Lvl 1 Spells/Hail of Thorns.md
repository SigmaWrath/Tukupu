As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">*Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*</span>**: The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 1.
