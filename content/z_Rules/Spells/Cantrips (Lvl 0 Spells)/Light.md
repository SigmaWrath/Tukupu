You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.  

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
