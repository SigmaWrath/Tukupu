|Casting Time|Range|Components|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bonus Action|Self|V, S, M (a sumac leaf)|Concentration, up to 10 minutes|


You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a Bonus Action. 

As a Magic action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. 

The flaming blade sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 10 feet. 

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</span>***: The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.
