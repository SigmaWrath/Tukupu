|Casting Time|Range|Components|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Action|60 feet|V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)|Concentration, up to 10 minutes|

For the duration, magical [[Darkness (Rules)|Darkness]] spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [[Darkvision]] can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. 

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness. 

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Bright Light]] or [[Dim Light]] created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
