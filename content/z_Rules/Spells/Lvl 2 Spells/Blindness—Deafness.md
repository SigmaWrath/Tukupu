One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [[Blinded]] or [[Deafened]] condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.  

***<span style="color:rgb(134, 93, 187)">Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</span>***: You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
