A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet. 

Until the spell ends, you have Resistance to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 Radiant damage on a hit. 

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[Blinded]] condition until the end of your next turn.
