|Casting Time|Range|Components|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Action|60 feet|V, S|1 hour|

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is [[Bright Light]] and sheds [[Dim Light]] for an additional 60 feet. 

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight. 

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Darkness]] created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
